# Bio semantic-web technologies
In this repository are shown basical bio semantic-web technology examples

### Bio semantics on metabolic netwoks and XSLT\RDF
Is this document are represented some technologies for modelling and mapping a Knowledge Base from XSLT to RDF on a [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) metabolic network. Are described the R libraries to import and update an RDF\OWL, changing the semantic formats.

### Bio semantics on chemical compunds ([OpenTox ontology](http://ambit.sourceforge.net/download_ontologyservice.html)), R and SPRQL.
It is shown an example of interrogation of an ontology web service. Then, it is shown an example of data-integration with SPARQL and triples stores for recognising enantiomers across their simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES).

### Bio semantics on [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/) proteins with R and SPRQL.
Finally it is shown an example of a SPARQL endpoint for building a new model through the “construct” command.
