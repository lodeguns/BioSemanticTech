# Bio semantic-web technologies
Bio web semantic technologies some examples leveraging R, RDF, XSLT and SPARQL. Please follow the [PDF documentation](https://github.com/lodeguns/BioSemanticTech/blob/master/Bio%20Semantic%20%20Source%20Code.R) and its relative references and the related source code in XSLT [here](https://github.com/lodeguns/BioSemanticTech/tree/master/KEGG%20XSLT) and in R [here](https://github.com/lodeguns/BioSemanticTech/blob/master/Bio%20Semantic%20%20Source%20Code.R)

## Bio semantics on metabolic netwoks and XSLT\RDF
Is this document are represented some technologies for modelling and mapping a Knowledge Base from XSLT to RDF on a metabolic network. Are described the R libraries to import and update an RDF\OWL, changing the semantic formats.

## Bio semantics on chemical compunds, R and SPRQL.
It is shown an example of interrogation of an ontology web service. Then, it is shown an example of data-integration with SPARQL and triples stores for recognising enantiomers.

## Bio semantics on Uniprot proteins and SPRQL.
Finally it is shown an example of a SPARQL endpoint for building a new model through the “construct” command.
