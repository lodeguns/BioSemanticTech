# Bio semantic-web technologies
Bio semantic-web technology examples leveraging R, RDF, XSLT and SPARQL are shown.

### Bio semantics on metabolic netwoks and XSLT\RDF
Is this document are represented some technologies for modelling and mapping a Knowledge Base from XSLT to RDF on a metabolic network. Are described the R libraries to import and update an RDF\OWL, changing the semantic formats.

### Bio semantics on chemical compunds, R and SPRQL.
It is shown an example of interrogation of an ontology web service. Then, it is shown an example of data-integration with SPARQL and triples stores for recognising enantiomers.

### Bio semantics on Uniprot proteins and SPRQL.
Finally it is shown an example of a SPARQL endpoint for building a new model through the “construct” command.
